Sophia Guan had just about finished her frist-ever sculpture last year when it fell to the floor, shattering part of the work.

But instead of chucking it out and starting over, the Gleneagle secondary student collected the broken parts and fired them up in the school kiln.

Her fractured ceramic art, Hive Mind, a classical figure with honeycombs on its head, can now be seen in the Art Gallery at Evergreen Cultural Centre's23rd annual Emerging Talent show.

For Guan, she's not only pleased with the way the curators presented her shattered sculpture, she's also honoured to have her art in a public setting.

"It's really special to be a part of this." she said Monday while studying the dozens of picecs by her SD43 peers."It's inspiring what others are doing."

Organized by Gleneagle secondary school teacher Robyn Corft, Emerging Talent is a juried show that runs until Feb. 16; it also includes a People's Choice prize.

Retired SD43 art teachers Mike McElgunn, Jerry Pietrasko and Melanie Stokes were invited to select the art that would be displayed and, in total, chose 65 works from five high schools: Centennial, Gleneagle, Port Moody, Dr. Charles Best and Port Moody.
